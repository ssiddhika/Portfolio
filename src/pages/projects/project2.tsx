          <p className="text-base lg:text-lg text-base-content mb-4">
            Completed during my 2023 Summer internship at Optik Consultancy, this project involved designing and developing a Navisworks plugin for Hilti. Working in a cross-functional team over 12 weeks, we created a tool to help automate the quotation process for MEP supports in construction designs.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base lg:text-lg text-base-content">
            It was my first end-to-end engineering project with a live client, and it gave me hands-on experience with an entirely new tech stack and industry.

          <p className="text-base lg:text-lg text-base-content mb-4">
            Hilti receives BIM files containing MEP elements requiring structural supports like T-posts or trapezes. Traditionally, estimating these supports for quotations is manual and time-consuming.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base lg:text-lg text-base-content">
            Our solution automated the process by analyzing component geometry, location, and orientation, then suggesting supports using a reference database — and exporting results into a detailed spreadsheet.

          <p className="text-base lg:text-lg text-base-content mb-4">
            This project introduced me to the construction tech industry and gave me deep exposure to BIM workflows. I learned how to integrate external APIs, conduct rigorous testing, and collaborate in an agile scrum team.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base lg:text-lg text-base-content">
            Through mentorship, independent research, and stakeholder engagement, I strengthened my problem-solving skills, adaptability, and ability to work across disciplines. It was a rewarding challenge that taught me to manage uncertainty and technical complexity effectively.
