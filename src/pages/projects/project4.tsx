            As part of Powerhouse's Creative Studios program, I co-facilitated a workshop series introducing high school students to the intersection of artificial intelligence and space technology. Students collaborated in teams to design spacecrafts and discuss ethical AI decision-making in extreme environments.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base lg:text-lg text-base-content">
            This was a dynamic educational experience combining STEM education, design thinking, and soft skills â€” all within a real-world aerospace context.

          <p className="text-base lg:text-lg text-base-content mb-4">
            The workshop helped students explore career paths in space, AI, and engineering through hands-on learning. It also fostered critical thinking around ethical technology development.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base lg:text-lg text-base-content">
            The success of this initiative led to discussions about expanding similar formats to future outreach and STEM education events at UTS.
